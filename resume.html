Education
---------

Duke University
:   Talent Identification Program; Japanese, Number Theory

University of Southern California
:   Resident Honors Program
    *Attended college courses in lieu of senior year of high school*

University of Kansas
:   BA, Philosophy; emph. Primatology
    *Focus on analytic philosophy, epistemology, and human evolution
    *Discovered a novel paradox of substitution for an "impossible" assigment, which led the Department to create a TA position for me to teach logic to other students
    *Researched the expensive tissue hypothesis and other bounding rules governing evolutionary systems

University of Kansas School of Law
:   Juris Doctorate
    *Founded Cyberlaw Society
    *Researched contracts in virtual worlds
    *Contributions to Jurisprudence (the theory of legal decisionmaking) resulted in revisions to the Professor's course outline
    *Graduated early due to large courseload

Experience
----------

**U.S. Department of State**
:   Political Officer

Worked with industry and government to harden cybersecurity and improve trust in complex systems.

**CIA**
: Analytic manager

Built and led a team of dozens of cyber threat analysts. Oversaw overarching research strategy with a focus on balancing rigor and accessibility. Recruited, mentored, and developed analysts from diverse backgrounds.

**CIA**
: Cyber threat analyst

Wrote and briefed finished analysis, regularly featured in the President's Daily Brief. Principal intelligence briefer to the Special Assistant to the President and Cybersecurity Coordinator for the National Security Council (the President's lead for cyber issues). Principal briefer to cyber leads at State, DOE, DOD, DHS (CISA), and the FCC.

**Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Department of Energy), Critical Infrastructure Protection**
: Analyst

Led contributions to standards development, incident investigation, audits, and administrative rulemaking (notice and comment) all designed to help improve the reliability of a complex system.  Researched emergent behavior and cascading failures in distributed systems as well as attacks and defenses.

Open source contributions
--------------------

Anki
:   Flash card software 

Used heavily by language learning and medical school communities. My contributions eased extensibility for tweaking the scheduling algorithm. 
I developed and maintained a well reviewed and popular (95th %ile) extension that smoothed performance based feedback in the reviewing schedule so the program could "learn" which cards were easier and harder over time.
Required incorporating concepts from pedagogy and memory research.
I also developed new card templates using the Solarized color scheme to reduce brightness contrast while preserving hue contrast, to improve readability and reduce eyestrain for long reviewing sessions.
These contributions relied on js, CSS, Qt, Rust, and predominantly Python.

python-jamo
: Hangul analysis. 

Package that aids in decomposition and reconstruction of Korean language (hangul) text, enabling easier text analysis and machine-assisted scientific research. I extended support to cover archaic hangul, which improved tooling for scholars performing text analysis on works from the early Joseon dynasty.

ebisu
: Bayesian inference engine for intelligent flash card scheduling.
My contributions helped further tune the algorithm to existing research on memory and learning.


Hobbies
----------------------------------------

Language learning, playing board games, cooking, watching old movies, rocking out on the drums
