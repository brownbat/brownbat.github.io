Experience
----------

**U.S. Department of State**
:   Political Officer

Worked with industry and government to harden cybersecurity and improve trust in complex systems.

**CIA**
: Analytic manager

Built and led a team of dozens of cyber threat analysts. Oversaw overarching research strategy with a focus on balancing rigor and accessibility. Recruited, mentored, and developed analysts from diverse backgrounds.

**CIA**
: Cyber threat analyst

Wrote and briefed finished analysis, regularly featured in the President's Daily Brief. Principal intelligence briefer to the Special Assistant to the President and Cybersecurity Coordinator for the National Security Council (the President's lead for cyber issues). Principal briefer to cyber leads at State, DOE, DOD, DHS (CISA), and the FCC.

**Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Department of Energy), Critical Infrastructure Protection**

Led contributions to standards development, incident investigation, audits, and administrative rulemaking (notice and comment) all designed to help improve the reliability of a complex system.  Researched emergent behavior and cascading failures in distributed systems as well as attacks and defenses.

Open source contributions
--------------------

Anki
:   Flash card software 

Used heavily by language learning and medical school communities. My contributions eased extensibility for tweaking the scheduling algorithm. 
I developed and maintained a well reviewed and popular (95th %ile) extension that smoothed performance based feedback in the reviewing schedule so the program could "learn" which cards were easier and harder over time.
Required incorporating concepts from pedagogy and memory research.
I also developed new card templates using the Solarized color scheme to reduce brightness contrast while preserving hue contrast, to improve readability and reduce eyestrain for long reviewing sessions.
These contributions relied on js, CSS, Qt, Rust, and predominantly Python.

* These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**
