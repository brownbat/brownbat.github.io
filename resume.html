<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p><strong>U.S. Department of State</strong>
:  Political officer</p>
<p>Worked with industry and government to harden cybersecurity and improve trust in complex systems.</p>
<p><strong>CIA</strong>
:  Analytic manager</p>
<p>Built and led a team of dozens of cyber threat analysts. Oversaw overarching research strategy with a focus on balancing rigor and accessibility. Recruited, mentored, and developed analysts from diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>CIA</strong>
:  Cyber threat analyst</p>
<p>Wrote and briefed finished analysis, regularly featured in the President&#39;s Daily Brief. Principal intelligence briefer to the Special Assistant to the President and Cybersecurity Coordinator for the National Security Council (the President&#39;s lead for cyber issues). Principal briefer to cyber leads at State, DOE, DOD, DHS (CISA), and the FCC.</p>
<p><strong>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Department of Energy)</strong>
:  Energy Analyst (Critical Infrastructure Protection)</p>
<p>Led contributions to standards development, incident investigation, audits, and administrative rulemaking (notice and comment) all designed to help improve the reliability of the grid and its components.  Researched emergent behavior and cascading failures in distributed systems as well as emerging and theoretical attacks, natural failures, and defenses.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-contributions">Open source contributions</h2>
<p><strong>Anki</strong>
:  flash card software</p>
<p>Used heavily by language learning and medical school communities. My contributions to the core program eased extensibility for tweaking the scheduling algorithm. </p>
<p><strong>Auto Ease Factor</strong> extension and <strong>Card templates</strong>
:  Anki extension for automatic tuning review schedules</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I developed and maintained a well reviewed and popular (95th %ile) extension that smoothed performance based feedback in the reviewing schedule so the program could &quot;learn&quot; which cards were easier and harder over time. This required incorporating concepts from pedagogy and memory research. </p>
</li>
<li><p>I separately developed new card templates using the Solarized color scheme to reduce brightness contrast while preserving hue contrast, to improve readability and reduce eyestrain for long reviewing sessions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>These contributions relied on js, CSS, Qt, Rust, and predominantly Python.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>python-jamo</strong>
:  hangul analysis</p>
<p>Package that aids in decomposition and reconstruction of Korean language (hangul) text, enabling easier text analysis and machine-assisted scientific research. I extended support to cover archaic hangul, which improved tooling for scholars performing text analysis on works from the early Joseon dynasty.</p>
<p><strong>ebisu</strong>
:  Bayesian inference engine for intelligent flash card scheduling.</p>
<p>My contributions helped further tune the algorithm to existing research on memory and learning.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p>Language learning, playing board games, cooking, watching old movies, rocking out on the drums</p>
